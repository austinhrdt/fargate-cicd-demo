			<!-- CONTAINERS -->
			<section data-background-color="indigo">
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<h2>Containers</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>What is a container?</p>
					<br>
					<p>In the most basic of definitions, a container is an isolated runtime environment that is used to
						host an application and it's dependencies</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>How is that different than a VM?</p>
					<br>
					<p>Both are similarly provisioned using images. You can think of an image as a template for creating
						new instances</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>VMs contain their own OS, allowing them to perform multiple resource-intensive functions at once
						(e.g., monoliths)</p>
					<br>
					<p>This means VMs are quite heavy (GBs), hence take a relatively long time to provision</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>Containers use a shared OS and are often used to package single functions to perform specific
						tasks (e.g., microservices)</p>
					<br>
					<p>Containers are lightweight (MBs) and provision quickly. This gives them high portability</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>A major advantage with containers is that OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are
						abstracted away.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Discrepancies between production and staging environments? What's that?</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>Containers are better suited for microservice architecture. VMs are better for monolithic
						architecture.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Which is better?</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>Decoupled applications allow each compontent to perform its tasks independantly. A change in one
						service shouldn't require a change in other services</p>
					<br>
					<p>Using containers as microservices opens the door to horizontal scalability and high availablity
					</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="indigo">
					<p>Quick recap of the benefits of containers in a microservice architecture</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Lightweight, portable, and rapid provisioning</li>
						<li>Decoupled and highly available</li>
						<li>Reproducible and horizontally scalable</li>
						<li>No infrastructure discrepancies between environments</li>
					</ul>

			<!-- CICD -->
			<section>
				<section data-background="#17202a">
					<h2>CICD</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#17202a">
					<p>Besides version control, a decent branching strategy, and the actual source code, CICD is the
						most important component of software applications</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#17202a">
					<p>Why? It removes the human from performing repetivite tasks. Humans make mistakes, we shouldn't
						manually execute high risk tasks &#8212 such as production deployments</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#17202a">
					<p>All repetivite tasks should either be eliminated or automated. Automation reduces the room for
						error and saves engineers time, allowing for them to focus on developing a good product</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#17202a">
					<p>My Philosophy</p>
					<br>
					<p>Continously introduce small changes to production each day. To achieve this, invest in tooling,
						quality assurance processes, visiblity, and automation</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="#17202a">
					<p>There are many CICD tools you can use for this; let's discuss why I chose...</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<!-- GitHub Actions -->
			<section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<h2>GitHub Actions</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<p>Why GitHub Actions? How is it any different than these platforms?</p>
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li>Jenkins</li>
						<li>TeamCity</li>
						<li>Bamboo</li>
						<li>CircleCI</li>
						<li>Travis CI</li>
						<li>Concourse CI</li>
					</ul>

				<section data-background="white">
					<h4>Advantages of GitHub Actions</h4>
				</section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<p><b>Convience.</b> Harbour your source code, version control, branch managment, secrets, workflows, etc., <b>all in one place</b></p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<p><b>Customization.</b> Common events in GitHub can trigger custom workflows. For example, triaging workflows can automatically assign, create, and close cards on a project board based on the status of issues or pull requests</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<p><b>Modern.</b> It's new, serverless, open source, and backed by Microsoft</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<p>Of all the CICD tools I've used personally, GitHub Actions has provided the simplest and most intuitive experience</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="white">
					<p>Now let's jump into how I'm using GitHub Actions with...</p>
				</section>

			<!-- AWS Fargate -->
			<section>
				<section data-background="darkred">
					<h2>AWS Fargate</h2>
				</section>
				<section data-background="darkred">
					<p>What is AWS Fargate?</p>
					<br>
					<p>A. Serverless containers</p>
				</section>
				<section data-background="darkred">
					<p>why fargate instead of ecs or eks</p>
					<p>Fargate is a service you can use to run containers on AWS ECS without having to manage servers or clusters of EC2 instances. Basically, its serverless containers.</p>
