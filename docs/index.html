						<h2>Containers</h2>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>What is a container?</p>
						<br>
						<p>In the most basic of definitions, a container is an isolated runtime environment that is used to host an application and it's dependencies</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>How is that different than a VM?</p>
						<br>
						<p>Both are similarly provisioned using images. You can think of an image as a template for creating new instances</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>Containers use a shared OS and are often used to package single functions to perform specific tasks (e.g., microservices)</p>
						<br>
						<p>Containers are lightweight (MBs) and provision quickly. This makes them portable.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>VMs contain their own OS, allowing them to perform multiple resource-intensive functions at once (e.g., monoliths)</p>
						<br>
						<p>This means VMs are quite heavy (GBs), hence take a relatively long time to provision</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>A major advantage with containers is that OS distributions and underlying infrastructure are abstracted away.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Discrepancies between production and staging environments? What's that?</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>Containers are better suited for microservice architecture. VMs are better for monolithic architecture.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Which is better? Hint: not monolithic</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>Decoupled applications allow each compontent to perfrom its tasks independantly. A change in one service shouldn't require a change in other services</p>
						<br>
						<p>Using containers as microservices opens the door to horizontal scalability and high availablity</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="lightblue">
						<p>Quick recap of the benefits of containers in a microservice architecture</p>
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>Lightweight, portable, and rapid provisioning</li>
							<li>Decoupled and highly available</li>
							<li>Reproducible and horizontally scalable</li>

					</section>
					<section data-background="#17202a">
						<p>Besides version control, a decent branching strategy, and the actual source code, CICD is the most important component of software applications</p>
					</section>
